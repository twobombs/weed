.SH NAME
weed_cl_precompile \- precompile vm6502q/weed OpenCL programs
.SH LIBRARY
vm6502q/weed minimalist AI/ML inference and backprogation library (in the style of Qrack)
.SH SYNOPSIS
Run this executable to "pre-compile" OpenCL programs for Weed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
"weed_cl_precompile" is an executable command built and installed by the "weed" library. Based upon your available OpenCL ICDs for your GPUs and accelerators, running "weed_cl_precompile" will compile the OpenCL program of weed for all visible ICDs and save intermediate representation in the ~/.weed directory. When Weed executables run, instead of recompiling their OpenCL programs every time, the "pre-compiled" intermediate representations in ~/.weed will be used. (To stop using pre-compiled kernels, delete them from the ~/.weed directory.)
